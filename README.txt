编译环境：使用浏览器打开index即可，
开发进程：主页建设完成，功能分区因无具体代码保留源代码页面。
开发思路：使用原生前端语言修订，便于其他开发者审阅，便于后续其他功能开发，便于后续融入框架
然后不知道写什么了，自己看吧，一看就知道怎么回事了

Forked From Forty by HTML5 UP

This is Forty, my latest and greatest addition to HTML5 UP and, per its incredibly
creative name, my 40th (woohoo)! It's built around a grid of "image tiles" that are
set up to smoothly transition to secondary landing pages (for which a separate page
template is provided), and includes a number of neat effects (check out the menu!),
extra features, and all the usual stuff you'd expect. Hope you dig it!
